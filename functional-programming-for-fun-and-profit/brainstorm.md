* definition (lambda calculus, declarative programming, etc.)
* languages + code samples (lisp, f#, js, powershell, haskell, scala, clojure, ruby, c#, java)
* declarative siblings (db query language, regex, DSLs, reactive, excel)
* immutability as a feature
* state (is bad, is inevitable)
* what vs. how
* currying
* list comprehension with functions
* pattern matching
* lazy evaluation
* function vs. closure vs. lambda vs. proc
* programming with nothing (http://codon.com/programming-with-nothing)
* mobile app sdks (android/ios)
* truly reduced coupling
* purity vs. non-purity
* variables, boo!
* SICP
* resources to learn FP
* monads (maybe pattern, etc.)
* my history (scheme in ITB001, heard about map/reduce re. Google)
